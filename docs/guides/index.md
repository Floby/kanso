# Kanso Guides


## [Getting Started](getting_started.html)

Installation and a gentle introduction to the Kanso framework. In this tutorial
you'll create a simple blog app and learn how to use the Kanso admin interface.

## [How Kanso Processes Requests](how_kanso_processes_requests.html)

Kanso makes it easy to re-use code between the client and server wherever
possible, but to be used effectively you must understand how requests are
processed.

## [Sharing Code With Views](sharing_code_with_views.html)

As of CouchDB 1.1.0, its possible to share modules between your view functions
and your normal application code. This guide explains the process of adding
shared modules to a Kanso project.

## [Writing Guides](writing_guides.html)

One of the best ways to give back to the Kanso project is to help others get
started. You don't have to be an expert, you just need to have learned something
that should be better documented.
